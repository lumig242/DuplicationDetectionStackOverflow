    "StackOverflow is the largest online QA platform for programmers to ask, answer various questions and learn new knowledge and technique. By the end of August 2015, there are more than 10,000,000 questions posted on Stack Overflow. However, As the number of questions grows, we may find that there are more and more questions that focuses on the same topic or features, or actually have the same answers. We define these questions as duplicate questions. Duplicate questions will waste the machine resources and made question raiser to wait for a long time for a queston that has been answered already. Currently, Stack Overflow encourage users to manually mark any potential duplicate questions, which is not efficient and may have some bias. Here is an example of duplicate questions:"

We collect the raw XML-formatted data from Stackoverlow archive and stored the clean data into MySQL. Then We extract four features, namely, **title, topic, post and tag**, calculate the distance among them using LDA model and cosine/jaccard similarity. After that, we partition our dataset, and train our model using 70% of the original dataset using **logistic regression**. Finally we validate our model using the validation set, and tune some parameters to achieve the best precision."
